The Lords of the Realm 2 Conqueror Dashboard

- Micro-manage at a glance!
- Displays all town properties in the form of the standard right menu
- Turns so far
- Reveal hidden town names!! (no they're not secret quests, just the name of land that isn't a town, sorry!)
- Give yourself tons of gold, happiness or anything your heart desires

TODO
- Display kingdom stats for other players (weapons, money, etc)
- UI is horrible and slow (because of transparency), speed up and pretty up
- Figure out how to cram player color for a town
- An actual EXE release :|
