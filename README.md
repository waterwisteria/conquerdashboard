The Lords of the Realm 2 Conqueror Dashboard

- Micro-manage at a glance!
- Works on your second monitor (needed)
- Give yourself tons of gold, happiness or anything to your heart desires
- Displays all town properties in the form of the standard right menu, including enemies (if they destroy your fields you can spy on them, it's ok)
- Turns so far
- Reveal hidden town names!! (No they're not secret quests, just the name of land that isn't a town. SORRY!)


## Cheating hotkeys
Use Control and the resource you wish to add (first letter of ressource).

### Global properties
- Gold
- Iron
- Stone
- Lumber

### Town properties (must be selected)
- Happiness
- Population
- Cows
- Wheat


TODO
- Display kingdom stats for other players (weapons, money, etc)
- UI is horrible and slow (because of transparency and too many controls), speed up and pretty up
- Health bar not displaying health
- Release hotkeys when Lords2 not in focus
- An actual EXE release :|

ISSUES
- When the dashboard is running you can't use any of the hotkeys anywhere because they're "jacked". Control-C and S being the most used culprit.
- I can't figure out how the game computes the red border around cows. It's related to the amount of dairy maids per field per cows (most likely) and an unknown multiplier or factor.
- Some added ressources will not display automatically, you need to switch town before they can be seen. Alternatively the dashboard will display them right away. ;)
